### Introduction

This is my dotfiles repository that I run for easy moving my configuration to another pc.
Of course this repository can also serve for anyone else that wants to see what kind of configuration is needed for my kind of desktop and experience

### Main points:

- `linux` only (sorry windows and mac users)
- Probably made to personal so don't expect to find some gold here
- This is something that I do for fun
- Updates are probably gonna be in this fachio: 1 month no updates and the 100 updates in a day
- There is probably going to be a lot of `broken` english here
- That is it for the points

### .config

My .config folder that most of my programs use.

Now I will individually explain every program that uses this folder and link their respective config and provide a screenshot.

#### [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

`Alacritty` is the my terminal emulator of choice because it is fast on my very low spec machine.

With it's gpu support a lot of commands and cli programs are running much faster for me.

Before using I used a lot of treminal emulator like `st`, `urxvt`, `termite` and so on but only `Alacritty` made me want to come back to it.

Color scheme that I use [`Material`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/wiki/Color-schemes#material-theme) that I found on the `Alacritty` github page and I fell in love with it.

Here is the `Alacritty` [config](/blob/master/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml).
