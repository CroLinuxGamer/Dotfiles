### Introduction

This is my dotfiles repository that I run for easy moving my configuration to another pc.
Ofcourse this repository can also serve for anyone else that wants to see what kind of configuration is needed for my kind of desktop and experience

#### Main points:

- `linux` only (sorry windows and mac)
- Probably made to personal so don't expect to find some gold here
- This is something that I do for fun
- Updates are probably gonna be in this fachio: 1 month no updates and the 100 updates in a day
- There is probably going to be a lot of `broken` english here
- That is it for the points
